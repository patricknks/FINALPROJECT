## Autonomous Quadcopter Landing on a Moving Object with Gimballed-Camera and Robot Operating System (ROS) Framework

A repo for my Bachelor's Degree Final Froject development. The project was aimed to develop a system that gives an ability for a quadcopter to land on a moving object. This repo was created to develop the system inside gazebo simulation, therefore there are several differences in the systems that are being used in this repo than the repo for the actual quadcopter itself.
